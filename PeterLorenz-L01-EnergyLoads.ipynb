Rather the heating and cooling loads fluctuate as surface area increases. The remaining variables do not appear fully to explain these fluctuations. It is possible that the relative stability of the heating loads of the lower buildings is explained by the fact they all have the same roof surface area (220.5 square meters). Yet there is no corresponding pattern among the taller buildings. Between configurations with surface areas of 563.5 and 588 square meters respectively, the roof area increases by 24.5 square meters, but the heating load goes down. At the same time, between configurations with surface areas of 612.5 and 637 square meters, the roof area remains constant, but the heating load increases dramatically.
